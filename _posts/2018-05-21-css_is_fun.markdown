Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a fun way to style web pages. Each webpage has a layout and each section of the page can be styled. You can adjust the page margins, title size, fonts, lineweights, colors - the possibilities are endless! I have always loved picking colors and fonts so CSS is exciting to me.
