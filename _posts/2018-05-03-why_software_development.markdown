I have always been a creative person. Some of my first memories are of me making art. I used to frequent the local Boys & Girls Club and spend the entire day in the Art room. I built bird houses, picture frames, and even painted banners for club events.  At university I studied Architecture and Sustainable Design and continued my practice of art and design. As a student, I gained a passion for environmental sustainability and learned how to apply it to my art.

After graduation, I pursued a career in Design Engineering and began working for a solar tech company - where I still work today over 4 years later.  I work on the mechanical side of things designing solar products. I love the company I work for and that their commitment to environmental sustainability aligns with my own values.

Ever since starting my career in the tech industry, I have wanted to learn software development. I feel that it is a necessary skill to have if working in tech today - especially working in San Francisco tech. I know that with my backround in art, design, and engineering, that I will be a great Software Engineer one day. My ultimate goal is to work at an environmental sustainability company as a Software Engineer and to develop software that helps the Earth and all the people on it.
